      <h1>About</h1>
      <p><a href="https://jakobanderson.com">I'm Jakob Anderson.</a> I am a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer, and Web Performance Champion.</p>
      <p>Why I started it:</p>
      <p>Like many in my field, I graduated from college with much more debt than I thought my 
      education was worth, since the college was so far behind in my field that I ended up teaching 
      myself most of the things I needed to get a job. I learned at work, and I learned while making 
      fun side-projects. I feel no one should have to struggle in debt to learn or raise their skill 
      level.</p>
      <p>I believe that knowledge should be free, but it needed to be organized. I'd found that most 
      of the best learning resources either cost money, or are hard to find 
      and disorganized.</p>
      <p>I wanted to help newer developers know the path and train for free, so I could "pay it forward" 
      for those that helped me along the way</p>
      <p>I believe in "learning by doing", and I formed this service with that in mind. If you stay 
      organized, and work hard on this every day, you may be able to improve your lot in life, and 
      you will have earned it.</p>
