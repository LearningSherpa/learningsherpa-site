# Learning Sherpa

An open-source, free learning platform. 
> Knowledge *should* be free, but it *must* be organized!

This project collects the best freely available training materials into an easy-to-use 
self-training program that is free to use, and open-source.

You will be guided through learning programs by experienced industry veterans. 
They know what you need to know to succeed, and the best places to find things.
